## Description
 
 Burger Buns is a restaurant application that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat that follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node.js and MySQL to query and route data and Handlebars to generate the HTML. The user can enter a burger name in the input field and click submit. It will generate the input burger's name with a 'Devour it!' and 'close' buttons. The user can click on the button to devour the burger or 'close' to delete it. The burger can be remade after being devoured by clicking on 'Remake it!' button.
